# Bootstrap and Other Frameworks

This folder contains work for Lesson 4, Bootstrap and Other Frameworks, for the Udacity Intro to HTML & CSS course. The coursework uses Bootstrap 3, rather than 4, so I've completed the assignment using Bootstrap 3.3, in order to more closely follow the steps in the course.
